# ChefToad
A game prototype build in unity with a team of 4

The game had to be based on Captain Toad : treasure tracker so we decided to go with a food theme. 
My main tasks were coding (C#) the camera and player movement, 
I also worked on the UI and all the menu's. 
I also helped out on the artistic side: 
I rigged and animated the character, enemies and sushirolls and modeled and textured some assets as well. 

Prototype is available to play online using an xbox controller:

however the game wasn't targeted for webGL so may be somewhat unoptimized
